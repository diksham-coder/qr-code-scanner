# QR Code Scanner using OpenCV and Pyzbar

This project is a real-time QR code scanner built using Python, OpenCV, and pyzbar.
It detects and decodes QR codes using a webcam and stores scan history with timestamps.

## Features
- Real-time QR code detection using webcam
- Supports multiple QR codes
- Avoids duplicate scans
- Stores scan history in CSV file
- Displays decoded data on screen

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- pyzbar
- CSV
- Webcam

## How to Run
